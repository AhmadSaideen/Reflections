When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I need a remote repository to share my work with others; to help them or get recommandation from them in my work.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

May there will be multi developers on GitHub, so it is not suitable to recieve every commit automatecally.
